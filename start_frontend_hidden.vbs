' node has no windowless runtime like Python's pythonw.exe, so this hidden-launch
' shim is the node analog: WScript.Shell.Run with window-style 0 (hidden) and
' bWaitOnReturn = False (don't wait). The launched cmd/node gets its own hidden
' console, independent of whatever terminal started opensign.bat - so closing
' that terminal does NOT take the Vite server down. wscript itself is a
' GUI-subsystem host (no console), which is what makes the detachment clean.
'
' Runs from this file's own folder so it works regardless of caller cwd.
